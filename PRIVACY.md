Privacy Policy for Minimal Pomodoro
This Privacy Policy describes how the "Minimal Pomodoro" Chrome Extension (the "Extension") operates regarding user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

1. No Data Collection
The "Minimal Pomodoro" Extension is designed to be completely offline and internet/cloud free. It does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data, usage data, or any other information about you or your browsing activity. All functionalities, settings, and data (such as timer configurations or session history) are processed and stored exclusively on your local device.

2. Permissions Used and Their Justification
The Extension requests certain permissions solely to enable its core functionality as an offline study timer. These permissions are used strictly for local operations and do not facilitate any data collection or transmission:

alarms: Used to schedule and trigger timed events within the study timer, such as signaling the end of a study session or break. This allows the timer to operate reliably in the background and notify the user at appropriate times.

notifications: Used to display timely alerts to the user regarding the status of their study sessions and breaks. This includes notifying the user when a study period has ended or a break is over.

storage: Essential for saving user-specific settings and data locally on your device. This includes custom study durations, break times, sound preferences, and historical session data. All data is stored exclusively on your local device.

offscreen (If Applicable): If your extension uses the offscreen permission, please insert your specific justification here. For example: "Used to perform specific background tasks that require a DOM environment, such as playing custom audio alerts that require a web audio API context, ensuring the timer functions smoothly even when the popup is closed." If you do not use this permission, you can remove this bullet point.

host_permissions (If Applicable): If your extension uses host_permissions (e.g., file://*), please insert your specific justification here. For example: "This extension does not require broad host permissions for internet access. If any specific host permissions are listed (e.g., 'file://*'), they are solely for accessing local files for custom sound alerts stored on the user's computer and do not involve any internet communication or data transmission." If you do not use this permission, you can remove this bullet point.

The Extension does not use remote code. All code is bundled within the extension package.

3. No Third-Party Services
The Extension does not integrate with or rely on any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks that could collect or transmit your data.

4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating this page and the Extension's version number. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
